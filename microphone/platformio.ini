; --- Alternate environment for Heltec Wireless Tracker S3 ---
; If your exact Heltec board is not available in PlatformIO's board registry,
; use this env as a fallback. It builds for the S3 devkit but forces the
; serial monitor to 921600 and uses esptool upload. If you later find a
; PlatformIO board id for the Heltec tracker, replace the `board` value.
[env:heltec-s3-fallback]
platform = espressif32

; Optionally set upload_port or monitor_port here if you know the COM port
